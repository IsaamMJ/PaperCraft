═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ 1. Swap question type and section name in add section dialog
   Status: FIXED
   Change: Question type dropdown now appears FIRST, section name field appears SECOND
   Location: add_edit_section_dialog.dart (lines 267-321)
   Benefit: More intuitive flow - users select question type before naming the section
   Feedback: ___________________________________________________________


✅ 2. Add clear (X) button to section name field

   Change: Clear button appears when text is entered, allows quick field reset
   Implementation: IconButton with Icons.clear in suffixIcon, visible only when text.isNotEmpty
   Location: add_edit_section_dialog.dart (lines 302-309)
   Benefit: Users don't need to hold backspace - one tap clears the field
   Feedback: ___________________________________________________________


✅ 3. Grade levels & subjects - Changed from FilterChips to Checkboxes
   Status: FIXED
   Old: FilterChips required individual clicks for each item
   New: Checkboxes with "Select All" and "Clear" buttons
   Location: teacher_profile_setup_page.dart (lines 244-427)
   Benefit: One-click "Select All" instead of clicking each item individually
   Features:
   • "Select All" button - selects all grades/subjects with one click
   • "Clear" button - deselects all with one click
   • Individual checkboxes for granular control
   • Compact dense layout (no extra spacing)
   Feedback: ___________________________________________________________

   Method: _buildValidationSummary() now returns empty widget
   Important: Validation LOGIC still works (prevents submission if incomplete)
             Only the UI warning dialog was removed
   Benefit: Cleaner UI - no annoying red warning boxes
   Feedback: ___________________________________________________________



Phase 8
1. Add focus option to the add section model inputs
2. after completeing step 1 in the add questions button if it shows total marks it woul dbe good i feel
3. when the app has identified it as a shared word bank it must not navigate to the next question without having atleast one word bank option, suppose if the teacher forgets to add the word it woul dbecome a problem
4. in question create page ui many places doesnt not support double values for marks so it shows 0.5 as 0 .
5 for word forms input type i want to enter all the questions in that section in a single go just like true or false
6. we need an option two edit the section names after setting them , coz ain the final step i realize i made a spelling mistake and i am not able to correct it and have to start over again


phase 9
1. we need to maintaitn the same orfer in which the teacher created the question pattern , no need to reorganize it using marks
2.during submission if it fails due to any reason it must get saved as a draft
3. In add section in paper pattern only the first letter in the sentance must be capitalized, currently all the first letter of every word is being capitalized
4. Every time i open the app it asks for login , if i login once only after i log out it must log out until then it must be logged in only
5. Naotificaiton is not working need to debug that
6. Remove all the debug commands in the app
7. In word forms inputs remove the fist letter being capitalized coz they are nouns so they must not be captialized
8. In mcq options also remove the first letter being capitalized automatically
9. In question paper create above the input fields of all type of input it says add essay/short answer question or that particular input type instead of that i want that particular section name given to be displayed that would be more better
10. In paper details page exam date is set to 00:00 of date its not professional make hte time to be 10:00 AM
11. for match the following only main heading stating Match the following is enough no need individual question
12. In paper pattern i give for mcq question marks per question as 0.5 but when i enter all the questions and go to submit it the marks per mcq question changes to 1 . why is that ?similalry for fill in the blanks with shared question bankk also

PHASE 10

1. after ai polish for some questions it has Original Polished COrrected in this part check if the correct one is getting saved often polished and correct get saved as the question .
