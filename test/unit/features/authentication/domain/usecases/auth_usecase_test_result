00:01 +0 -1: AuthUseCase - initialize calls repository initialize method [E]
  Bad state: A test tried to use `any` or `captureAny` on a parameter of type `LogCategory`, but
  registerFallbackValue was not previously called to register a fallback value for `LogCategory`.

  To fix, do:

  ```
  void main() {
    setUpAll(() {
      registerFallbackValue(/* create a dummy instance of `LogCategory` */);
    });
  }
  ```

  This instance of `LogCategory` will only be passed around, but never be interacted with.
  Therefore, if `LogCategory` is a function, it does not have to return a valid object and
  could throw unconditionally.
  If you cannot easily create an instance of `LogCategory`, consider defining a `Fake`:

  ```
  class MyTypeFake extends Fake implements MyType {}

  void main() {
    setUpAll(() {
      registerFallbackValue(MyTypeFake());
    });
  }
  ```

  Fallbacks are required because mocktail has to know of a valid `LogCategory` to prevent
  TypeErrors from being thrown in Dart's sound null safe mode, while still
  providing a convenient syntax.

00:02 +0 -24: AuthUseCase - getUserById returns Left with failure when repository fails [E]
  Bad state: A test tried to use `any` or `captureAny` on a parameter of type `LogCategory`, but
  registerFallbackValue was not previously called to register a fallback value for `LogCategory`.

  To fix, do:

  ```
  void main() {
    setUpAll(() {
      registerFallbackValue(/* create a dummy instance of `LogCategory` */);
    });
  }
  ```

  This instance of `LogCategory` will only be passed around, but never be interacted with.
  Therefore, if `LogCategory` is a function, it does not have to return a valid object and
  could throw unconditionally.
  If you cannot easily create an instance of `LogCategory`, consider defining a `Fake`:

  ```
  class MyTypeFake extends Fake implements MyType {}

  void main() {
    setUpAll(() {
      registerFallbackValue(MyTypeFake());
    });
  }
  ```

  Fallbacks are required because mocktail has to know of a valid `LogCategory` to prevent
  TypeErrors from being thrown in Dart's sound null safe mode, while still
  providing a convenient syntax.
