- Better folder structure for features

  Phase 2: Architecture Strengthening (High Priority)

  - Remove direct sl<>() calls from domain/presentation layers
  - Inject all dependencies through constructors
  - Create proper abstractions for services
  - Standardize error handling with Result/Either pattern

  Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure (Medium Priority)

  - Unit tests for critical use cases
  - BLoC tests for business logic
  - Integration tests for key flows
  - Mock setup for testing

  Phase 4: Documentation (Medium Priority)

  - Architecture decision records (ADRs)
  - Feature documentation
  - API documentation
  - Setup guide for new developers

  Phase 5: Performance & Monitoring (Low Priority)

  - Performance profiling
  - Analytics integration
  - Crash reporting improvements
  - Memory leak detection

  My Recommendation: Start with Phase 1 & 2 - they'll give you the biggest ROI and make future development much easier.
